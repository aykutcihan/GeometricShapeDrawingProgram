Project: Geometric Shape Drawing Program

Requirements:

The program should ask the user for the type of geometric shape they wish to draw (e.g., circle, square, or rectangle).

Based on the input received from the user, the relevant shape should be drawn.

The program should be extensible, meaning that when new shapes are added, it should not require major changes to the existing code.

The program should use the same draw() method to draw different shapes, but this method should produce different outputs for different shapes.
